# Cmdlang expect tests

## Translation

In this directory we aim at having comprehensive coverage for the translation of cmdlang specifications to the supported backends.

We also aim at fully characterizing the behavior of the parsers that are obtained that way. We try to do a good job at capturing in the tests the subtle semantic differences that may be encountered depending on the backend chosen.

### Status?

We're currently increasing coverage as we go. We plan on reaching 100% coverage at the end of this process. Stay tune for progress on this front!
