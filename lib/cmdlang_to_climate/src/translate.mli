(** Translate cmdlang parsers to climate.

    The translation to climate is experimental, not well tested or documented,
    and doesn't support all features of climate. In particular there's currently
    no support to target the auto-completion features offered by climate. This
    is an area left for future work. More info
    {{:https://mbarbin.github.io/cmdlang/docs/explanation/future_plans/} here}. *)
