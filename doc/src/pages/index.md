Cmdlang is a library for creating command-line parsers in OCaml. Implemented as an OCaml EDSL, its declarative specification language lives at the intersection of other well-established similar libraries.

Cmdlang doesn't include an execution engine. Instead, Cmdlang parsers are automatically translated to `cmdliner`, `core.command`, or `climate` commands for execution.

Our goal is to provide an approachable, flexible, and user-friendly interface while allowing users to choose the backend runtime that best suits their needs.
