## Release status

### Pending releases

We have released the following packages to allow interested parties to experiment with cmdlang and provide early feedback.

| package              | released to opam |
|----------------------|:----------------:|
| cmdlang.opam         |   ✓              |
| cmdlang-to-cmdliner  |   ✓              |
| cmdlang-to-climate   |   ✓              |

### Planned releases

We also plan to release the translation to `core.command`. However, this will require additional work. Specifically, we aim to complete the coverage of that part of the code and exercise the translation using special configuration options in a tutorial.
