## Release status

### Pending releases

We plan to release the following packages soon to allow interested parties to experiment with cmdlang and provide early feedback.

| package              | released to opam |
|----------------------|:----------------:|
| cmdlang.opam         |   pending        |
| cmdlang-to-cmdliner  |   pending        |
| cmdlang-to-climate   |   pending        |

### Planned releases

| package              | released to opam |
|----------------------|:----------------:|
| cmdlang-to-base      |   planned        |

We also plan to release the translation to `core.command`. However, this will require additional work. Specifically, we aim to complete the coverage of that part of the code and exercise the translation using special configuration options in a tutorial.

### To be determined

| package                   | released to opam |
|---------------------------|:----------------:|
| err                       |   TBD            |
| err-cli                   |   TBD            |
| cmdlang-cmdliner-runner   |   TBD            |

These packages are more experimental and opinionated in nature. They will require further consideration and potential redesign before being released.
