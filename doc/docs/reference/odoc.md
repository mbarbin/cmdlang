| cmdlang.opam         |   pending        |
| cmdlang-to-cmdliner  |   pending        |
| cmdlang-to-climate   |   pending        |

### Planned releases

| package              | released to opam |
|----------------------|:----------------:|
| cmdlang-to-base      |   planned        |

We also plan to release the translation to `core.command`. However, this will require additional work. Specifically, we aim to complete the coverage of that part of the code and exercise the translation using special configuration options in a tutorial.
