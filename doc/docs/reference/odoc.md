## Release status

We have released an initial set of packages to allow interested parties to experiment with cmdlang and provide early feedback.

We plan to release the translation to `core.command` next. However, this will require additional work. Specifically, we aim to complete the coverage of that part of the code and exercise the translation using special configuration options in a tutorial.
