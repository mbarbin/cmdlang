# This workflow file is named 'more-ci' and is used to run additional CI checks
# that complement the main CI workflow. It ensures that our code is tested
# across multiple operating systems and OCaml compiler versions.
#
# Compared to the main 'ci.yml' job, this skips some steps that are not
# necessary to check for every combination of os and ocaml-compiler, such as
# generating coverage report, linting odoc, opam and fmt, etc.
#
# We prefer to keep it separate from the main CI workflow because we find it
# more readable, over having too many conditional steps in the same job.
