description: """\

[Cmdlang_stdlib_runner] is an execution engine for running command
line programs specified with [cmdlang].

It has no dependencies other than [cmdlang] and is implemented using
the [Arg] module from the OCaml standard library.

This package may be useful as a lightweight alternative to translating
cmdlang parsers to more feature-rich libraries such as [cmdliner],
[climate], or [core.command].
